            <div>Your ad may not be appearing for several reasons; here are some things to check.
                <ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
                    <li><strong>Valid payment method:</strong>Bing Ads requires a payment method on file before your ads can display. For info on payment methods, see <a class="HelpTopic" href="http://help.bingads.microsoft.com/help.aspx?market=en&amp;project=Bing_Ads&amp;querytype=topic&amp;query=HLP_BA_CONC_HOWBILLINGWORKS.htm" href_new="http://help.bingads.microsoft.com/#apex/3/en/52026/3" query="HLP_BA_CONC_HOWBILLINGWORKS.htm">What are my billing options?

                    <li><strong>Enabled status</strong>: Ads won't run if the related campaign, ad group, or keywords are not enabled. For information on changing their status, see <a class="HelpTopic" href="http://help.bingads.microsoft.com/help.aspx?market=en&amp;project=Bing_Ads&amp;querytype=topic&amp;query=HLP_BA_PROC_CHGSETTINGS.htm" href_new="http://help.bingads.microsoft.com/#apex/3/en/51044/1" query="HLP_BA_PROC_CHGSETTINGS.htm">How to change your status, bid and other settings</a> and <a class="HelpTopic" href="http://help.bingads.microsoft.com/help.aspx?market=en&amp;project=Bing_Ads&amp;querytype=topic&amp;query=HLP_BA_PROC_BULKEDIT.htm" href_new="http://help.bingads.microsoft.com/#apex/3/en/50831/1" query="HLP_BA_PROC_BULKEDIT.htm">Change a setting for multiple campaigns, ad groups, or keywords</a>.

                    <li><strong>Editorial review:</strong> Sometimes we just have to wait a bit. Most ads and keywords are approved and <em>Eligible</em> within 48-72 hours, though at times it can take longer. Product ads are on a similar timeline. Offers from your catalog are typically processed within 48 hours after we receive the feed. However, if you wait to create your product ad campaign until the feed is approved, that can take another 24 hours for the ads to be eligible to be served.

            <div>Here are some possible reasons why you're not seeing your ad, and what you can do:
                <ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
                    <li><strong>Enabled status </strong>: We list this issue several times in this article because it can be a very common issue. Ads won't run if the related campaign, ad group, or keywords are not enabled. Consider any changes you might have made since you last saw your ads. Did any those changes inadvertently pause some of your keywords or ad groups? Make sure to really go check, you might be surprised.

                    <li><strong>Low keyword bids:</strong> If your bids are too low for you to compete effectively in the marketplace, your ads may not be appearing on the first page of search results. They may not even be getting any impressions. Use the Ad Preview and Diagnostics tool to confirm that your ad's delivery can be resolved by raising the bid. If this is the case, the tool will suggest: "Bid too low" in its <span class="ui_item">Reason for not showing</span> column. The tool will then suggest a bid to test(or you can enter your own test values), allowing you to preview whether your ad will show based on the different bids. See <a class="HelpTopic" href="http://help.bingads.microsoft.com/help.aspx?market=en&amp;project=Bing_Ads&amp;querytype=topic&amp;query=HLP_BA_CONC_BIDDINGSTRATEGY.htm" href_new="http://help.bingads.microsoft.com/#apex/3/en/51018/1" query="HLP_BA_CONC_BIDDINGSTRATEGY.htm">Did I bid high enough</a> and <a class="HelpTopic" href="http://help.bingads.microsoft.com/help.aspx?market=en&amp;project=Bing_Ads&amp;querytype=topic&amp;query=HLP_BA_CONC_ABOUTBIDDING.htm" href_new="http://help.bingads.microsoft.com/#apex/3/en/51005/1" query="HLP_BA_CONC_ABOUTBIDDING.htm">What are keyword bids</a> for a bidding overview.

                    <li><strong>Catalog not uploaded correctly (Product ads):</strong> You must have a valid catalog uploaded successfully before your ads will display. For more information, see <a class="HelpTopic" href="http://help.bingads.microsoft.com/help.aspx?market=en&amp;project=Bing_Ads&amp;querytype=topic&amp;query=HLP_BA_PROC_CREATEBINGMERCHANTCENTERCATALOG.htm" href_new="http://help.bingads.microsoft.com/#apex/3/en/51086/1" query="HLP_BA_PROC_CREATEBINGMERCHANTCENTERCATALOG.htm">Submit your catalog feed</a> and <a class="HelpTopic" href="http://help.bingads.microsoft.com/help.aspx?market=en&amp;project=Bing_Ads&amp;querytype=topic&amp;query=HLP_BA_CONC_BMCSUBMITISSUE.htm" href_new="http://help.bingads.microsoft.com/#apex/3/en/51120/1" query="HLP_BA_CONC_BMCSUBMITISSUE.htm">Troubleshoot your Catalog Submission</a>.</li>
                    <li><strong>Poor ad position:</strong> Based on your keyword bids, your ads won’t necessarily display on the first page of search results. So if you've already used the Ad Preview and Diagnostics Tool and didn't see your ad previewed on the first search results page, check other pages. For help getting your ads on the first page, see <a class="HelpTopic" href="http://help.bingads.microsoft.com/help.aspx?market=en&amp;project=Bing_Ads&amp;querytype=topic&amp;query=HLP_BA_CONC_BIDDINGSTRATEGY.htm" href_new="http://help.bingads.microsoft.com/#apex/3/en/51018/1" query="HLP_BA_CONC_BIDDINGSTRATEGY.htm">Did I bid high enough</a>.</li>
                    <li><strong>Low budget:</strong> Ads stop running when your campaign budget is depleted. If your budget is using a daily option, then the budget refills at the start of the next day; for monthly budgets, at the start of the next month. For more info, see <a class="HelpTopic" href="http://help.bingads.microsoft.com/help.aspx?market=en&amp;project=Bing_Ads&amp;querytype=topic&amp;query=HLP_BA_CONC_ABOUTBUDGETTYPE.htm" href_new="http://help.bingads.microsoft.com/#apex/3/en/51006/1" query="HLP_BA_CONC_ABOUTBUDGETTYPE.htm">What are my budget options?</a>.</li>
                    <li><strong>Poor product target (Product ads):</strong> Your product target must be broad enough to include products in your catalog and successfully match those products with user search queries. First ensure your existing product targets match items in your catalog. For example, if you have set a filter for <em>Brand=Contoso</em>, your catalog should contain Contoso products. Next consider creating additional targets that are broad enough to include more of your products. In fact, it’s a best practice to have one target that includes your entire catalog.</li>

        <div expanded="false"><a href="javascript:;">I know my ad's running because I saw it yesterday, but now I can't find it.</a>
            <div>There are several reasons why you may not be seeing your ad today.
                <ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
                    <li><strong>Different ad position:</strong> If your ad appeared on the first search results page but isn't there now, first try checking the second (and later) pages. Changes by your competitors to their bids could be affecting your ad position, for example, causing your ad to drop to another search results page. See <a class="HelpTopic" href="http://help.bingads.microsoft.com/help.aspx?market=en&amp;project=Bing_Ads&amp;querytype=topic&amp;query=HLP_BA_CONC_WHATISADPOSITION.htm" href_new="http://help.bingads.microsoft.com/#apex/3/en/50825/1" query="HLP_BA_CONC_WHATISADPOSITION.htm">What is "ad position"</a> to learn more.</li>
                    <li><strong>Change to quality score:</strong> Check your quality score. If the quality score of a keyword is below 6, your ads may have limited eligibility to be served for that keyword. For more information, see <a class="HelpTopic" href="http://help.bingads.microsoft.com/help.aspx?market=en&amp;project=Bing_Ads&amp;querytype=topic&amp;query=HLP_BA_CONC_ABOUTQUALITYSCORE.htm" href_new="http://help.bingads.microsoft.com/#apex/3/en/50813/4" query="HLP_BA_CONC_ABOUTQUALITYSCORE.htm">What is the quality score</a>.</li>
                    <li><strong>Budget issues:</strong> Ads stop running when your campaign budget is depleted. For example, if you're using the daily budget option and you deplete your budget in the middle of the day, that's when your ad will stop running. For more info, see <a class="HelpTopic" href="http://help.bingads.microsoft.com/help.aspx?market=en&amp;project=Bing_Ads&amp;querytype=topic&amp;query=HLP_BA_CONC_ABOUTBUDGETTYPE.htm" href_new="http://help.bingads.microsoft.com/#apex/3/en/51006/1" query="HLP_BA_CONC_ABOUTBUDGETTYPE.htm">What are my budget options?</a>.</li>
                    <li><strong>Targeting:</strong> If you have scheduled your ad to run only on certain hours of the day or days of the week, you may be looking for your ad at the wrong time. For more info, see <a class="HelpTopic" href="http://help.bingads.microsoft.com/help.aspx?market=en&amp;project=Bing_Ads&amp;querytype=topic&amp;query=HLP_BA_CONC_TARGETING.htm" href_new="http://help.bingads.microsoft.com/#apex/3/en/51029/1" query="HLP_BA_CONC_TARGETING.htm">How can I get my ads in front of my customers?</a>.</li>

            <div>The Bing Ads Ad Preview and Diagnostics tool gives you a preview of which ads are appearing on the first search results page. If your ad is lower than ad position 9, the tool will not preview it for you.
